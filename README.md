# Cozy Notes

This project was created using React and the UI library Ant.design

### Overview

A simple notetaking and task tracking application built using React. The application was designed with simplicity and design in mind. 

#### What inspired me?
What inspired me to create this application was that I realized that a lot of notetaking application available today are overly complex and designed to use for groups of people rather than an individual who just wants to jot down notes and create simple todo lists.
I wanted to create an application that was both easy to use and productive. The application is an all in one productivity tool and designed with minimal and easy to navigate interface for those people that hate clutter.
